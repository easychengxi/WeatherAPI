WeatherAPI for StockX
Hi, I am using WorldWeatherOnline API to get weather data for Detroit and Chicago.
The Token is in the file. The date range I put for Jan 1 2019 to Jan 1 2020.
The query generates 2 CSV files with weather data. I will load it to S3 bucket for further ETL and reporting purposes
